## pain points

* food deserts <!-- element: class="fragment" -->
* time consuming price comparison <!-- element: class="fragment" -->
* finding dietary-specific items <!-- element: class="fragment" -->

## Identifiers
How do we identify foodstuffs in a way to compare across stores.

*PLUs
*UPCs

---

## PLUs

PLU stands for Price Look-Up code. These are the little numeric stickers you often see on fruits and vegetables. They help cashiers identify the item and its price at checkoutâ€”but they also tell you more than you might expect:

---

* 4-digit codes (e.g., 4011) mean the produce was grown conventionally.
* 5-digit codes starting with 9 (e.g., 94011) indicate the item is organic.
* 5-digit codes starting with 8 (e.g., 84011) were originally intended to mark genetically modified (GMO) produce, though this usage is rare and not consistently applied.
* Codes starting with 6 often refer to pre-cut or processed produce.

---

## UPCs

used on pre packaged foods

* but Del Monte Canned corn != CLover Valley Canned corn.
* so identfying equivlent products in upc will have to be retrieved from external databases like "Barcode Lookup"

---

## Data sources

How do we get the data?

* APIs
* site scraping
* phyical scanning
* crowd sourcing

---

## APIs

 some grocery chains via the information as "trade secrets" from an API point of view
* publix - appears to not have ANY way to get the information via API or scraping
* Walmart - appears to be avaliable, BUT you need to be a corporate partner
* food city - No API

---

## site scraping

* publix - doesn't have any prices on their site other than weekly specials
* food city - looks like with enough work it could be scraped

This can be really dicey,  the last place I worked had a significant income line providing scraping activity identification and 
protaction against scraping.

---

## physical scanning
scanning PLU/UPCs and prices by physical presence in the store.

* via cell phone tablet - extremely labor intensive.  Volunteer? 
* via automated systems Would I be arrested if I strolled throught the store with a google street view style setup
* WALL-E ?

---

## crowd sourcing

getting community involved somehow to scan/upload shopping receipts

* appeal to "it's for the general good"
* gameify it somehow ?
* somehow give financial rewards (coupons?,micropayments?)

---

## What we have so far

* front end
    * live demo
